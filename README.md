# P1_Domiance_vs_Epistasis
## This repository contains codes for generating the mathematical models and plots for the manuscript "Dominance vs. epistasis: the biophysical origins and plasticity of genetic interactions within and between alleles"

Firstly, you should set up your working path and check whether all the required packages have been installed in R.
Then, You can run the code in order: "1-Function.R", "2-Parameter_and_WT.R","3-Make_dataframe.R","4-Figure.R", and you will get the data and figures.

"1-Function.R"---It contains the mathematical models involved in this subject, and converts these mathematical formulas into the form of R language.

"2-Parameter_and_WT.R"---It contains the variable parameters applied to the models and the calculated values of wild-type phenotype under different parameters.

"3-Make_dataframe.R"---It contains all the code that uses the models to simulate and generate data. By the way, you can also run it directly and skip the first two files to get the data quickly.

"4-Figure.R"---It contains all the code used to generate figures.

【Notice】
It should be noted that the initial data generation may take a long time. Please wait patiently. You can also store the data on your local computer for the next call.
The quality of some generated pictures is high, which may cause the computer to jam. Please ensure that the computer has enough memory.
